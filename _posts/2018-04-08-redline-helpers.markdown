If you still have to redline specs (like I do on occasion) and don't want to use Sketch Measure, and still haven't transitioned to Figma for some reason, you may find this collection of symbols I created helpful. The symbols are a set of redline helpers -- both width/height measurement as well as area measurement. They use some relatively hacky Sketch methods to get the label backgrounds to expand automatically, but they work.

{% capture image_url %}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/redline-helper-symbols.png{% endcapture %}
{% include image.html src=image_url class="post_section" caption="An example of the redline symbols in use." %}


Let me know if you find them useful!
