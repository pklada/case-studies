**Update**

We had a lot of positive response from this component, so we decided to open source it! [Check out the project on github](https://github.com/Guidebook/gbkui-button-progress-view), and let me know if you use it!

I was recently inspired by Apple's progress buttons in the app store, so I decided to create my own to use within Guidebook. This is a screen recording of the actual button running in the app (not a prototype).

{% capture image_url %}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plada-loading-button.gif{% endcapture %}
{% include image.html src=image_url class="post_section" caption="Guidebook's new app store style progress button." %}

Let me know what you think on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pklada)!
