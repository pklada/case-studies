I recently redrew the logo for Guidebook as I had some free time and was inspired by all the logo redesigns happening lately.

Guidebook's logo was originally created from a slightly modified version of Rockwell. The initial modifications were minimal: cleaning up a few lines, some minor alignment, weighting and kerning. With this redraw, I took the existing logo and manually redrew each glyph, adjusting as necessary to achieve our objectives. We were attempting to adjust the logo to create more uniform construction, better alignment, consistent spacing and improved clarity.

Below is a quick .gif showing a comparison to the old logo, as well as some of the guides we created. I'll post in more detail about the process at a later time.
