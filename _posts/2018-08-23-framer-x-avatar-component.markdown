I recently created a simple avatar component for Framer X. Avatar components are quite simple, and often a starting point for design systems, but it was a fun exercise nonetheless. Learning about how Framer X structures its components, and allows for distribution on their store, was invaluable for mastering the tool.

The component supports photos and initials, any corner radius, male/female, and any arbitrary size. I'll be adding the ability to override the photo yourself, shortly.

{% capture image_url %}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/framer-x-avatar-component.png{% endcapture %}
{% include image.html src=image_url class="post_section" caption="An example of the component in use." canZoom=true %}

You can't currently link to components in the Framer X store, but it appears under the "recents" section.

An example of the component in use:
<div class="tweet" style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Step 3: Create a horizontal scrollable &quot;Stories&quot; feature for the app. I loved using Simple Avatar by <a href="https://twitter.com/pklada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pklada</a> - this component alone saved my upwards of 15 mins probably. <a href="https://t.co/WWz2A8hena">pic.twitter.com/WWz2A8hena</a></p>&mdash; Johnny Rodriguez (@tryjohnny) <a href="https://twitter.com/tryjohnny/status/1032426211035643906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>

Let me know if you use it in your designs!
