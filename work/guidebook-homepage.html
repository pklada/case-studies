        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>After a few years of the same home page for Guidebook, we decided it was time to give the page a facelift and
            update the messaging. This project involved working closely with marketing, and had contributions from each
            designer on the team.</p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
            <li>Refine the messaging of the home page to better describe and position Guidebook as a product</li>
            <li>Clearly represent Guidebook's competitive differentiators and value propositions</li>
            <li>Visually overhaul the page to better reflect Guidebook's branding, including the updated illustration
                style</li>
            <li>Optimize the page for SEO</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Success Measures</h3>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
            <li>An increase in page rank for high priority search terms ("event app")</li>
            <li>An increase in sign ups</li>
            <li>A decrease in bounce rate</li>
        </ol>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <ol class="post_subtitleList">
                <li>
                    <h4>Ideation with marketing</h4>
                    <p>The project began when we brought on a new VP of marketing who set an early goal of updating
                        Guidebook's homepage. This goal was determined for two primary reasons: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Guidebook's SEO rank had been slipping and we wanted to improve it, and</li>
                        <li>The homepage no longer fully reflected what Guidebook offers as a product and service</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I sat down with marketing and the design team and began ideating on the new page. We determined
                        early on that we wanted to focus the page around 4-5 features and concepts that Guidebook offers
                        which set us apart from the competition. These should also serve as value propositions - they
                        should double as things the customer can use to improve their business or event. This list was
                        narrowed to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ease of building and set-up</li>
                        <li>Security and scalability</li>
                        <li>Comprehensive branding</li>
                        <li>Award-winning support</li>
                        <li>Industry leading engagement features</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, we wanted to include some "social proof" for Guidebook, so customers would be
                        confident they could trust our service. To do this we settled on both a client use-case section,
                        as well as a logo list. </p>
                    <p>Finally, we decided we wanted to refine the hero section to include a simplified version of our
                        mission statement, as well as some representation of the app's UI to better communicate what
                        exactly Guidebook is.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Early concepts</h4>
                    <p>I worked with an illustrator on our team (Guillermo Mont) as well as a marketing designer (Emily
                        Suh) to design the initial concepts for the home page. These were initially sketched out on
                        whiteboards to play around with the structure and flow, and eventually made higher fidelity in
                        Sketch. We had come up with the motif of a "wave" which we had been using in marketing materials
                        and wanted to bring over to the new homepage. Additionally, we knew we wanted to lean heavily
                        into illustration. Our marketing designer put together a few concepts, including many variants
                        on the wave position and flow. These were narrowed to a single structure and flow that we were
                        happy with. </p>
                    <p>We sat down and whiteboarded various illustration ideas at this point too. We wanted the
                        illustrations to be friendly and approachable, yet feel distinct from the various other
                        illustration styles which were now popular. We also wanted the illustrations to heavily lean
                        into our brand colors so that the page felt cohesive and refined. After many illustration comps,
                        we landed on a set that we were happy with. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Refining the design</h4>
                    <p>Once the general design and illustration concepts were settled on, I worked closely with the
                        marketing designer on the team to produce higher fidelity versions of the page. At this point,
                        we were using placeholders for illustrations and device frames, so it was mainly refining the
                        spacing, structure, and layout of the page. It was important at this point to adapt the designs
                        for small screen sizes as well, as much of our homepage traffic comes from mobile. </p>
                    <p>At this point, our illustrator was working on the final versions of the illustrations, made in
                        Sketch. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Marketing sign-off</h4>
                    <p>Once we had the final page flow and layout, we presented to the marketing team to gather their
                        feedback and approval. We presented both the page with placeholders, and a version with photos
                        of the rough illustrations as placeholders. There was minor feedback, but nothing stopping us
                        from moving forward to development.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Development & implementation</h4>
                    <p>This phase is where my involvement became much more hands-on rather than direction. Having build
                        most of our marketing website, I knew the code-base well and could implement a new version of
                        the homepage quickly. There were a few main components I wanted to get right: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I wanted the page to be very lightweight with as few external calls as possible. Page speed
                            is important for SEO purposes and this was important to our goals for the project.</li>
                        <li>I wanted to have a dynamic section at the top of the page showing off the UI of the
                            application. Our design has always been a selling point of the product, and I wanted to
                            highlight it prominently.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To accomplish point one, I spent a lot of time optimizing both our code and assets used on the
                        page. We set up our images to always use injected SVGs where possible to prevent additional
                        network requests, and highly optimized bitmap images where not. We leaned in to using modern web
                        standards where possible, like <code>.webp</code> images and <code>srcset</code>. Additionally,
                        much of the app UI was recreated using pure HTML and CSS, to cut down on requests.</p>
                    <p>To create the floating device in the hero, I wanted to create something unique and not use a
                        pre-built device from an existing library. To do this, I downloaded a 3d model of an iPhone X
                        and opened it up in SketchUp. I spent some time adjusting the device textures and lighting to
                        get it to a point where it would match the general aesthetic of the page. </p>
                    <p>Next, I opened up the model in browser using three.js. This allowed me to play around with the
                        model and rotate it to get it to a position that felt natural within the hero section. I
                        considered using three.js to render the model in the production version of the page (and draw UI
                        on the device as a texture) but decided against the idea in the interest of speed. I ended up
                        exporting angles of the model as highly optimized bitmaps, and using CSS/HTML to insert the UI
                        screenshots and distort them to appear as if they were part of the model. This technique proved
                        both quite fast to iterate on, and the results were something I was happy with. </p>
                    <p>In addition to the device and app UI, I wanted to include some "floating" UI above the phone
                        frame to highlight important parts of the UI for the customer. Given that we were showcasing our
                        newsfeed feature in the app screenshot, I decided to float some newsfeed style cards above the
                        device, showing the customer some examples of the event-based content they could expect to see
                        on Guidebook (a popular sessions card, for example). </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Testing & launch</h4>
                    <p>Once development was complete, we sent an internal version of the page around to the company for
                        testing. We had team members walk through the sign up flow to verify that everything worked as
                        intended. Once we were confident, we pulled the trigger and sent the new page live. For a period
                        of time, we A/B tested how the new page performed against the old home page. This test was live
                        for about 2 weeks to gather enough data to confirm that the new page was indeed performing
                        better than the old one. After the A/B test was complete and the results were verified, we
                        deprecated the old home page. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Validating goals</h4>
                    <p>After the new home page was formally in place, we continued to monitor our site usage and traffic
                        to validate our initial success measures. Our sign up rate and conversion rate did indeed
                        increase, giving credence to both our value propositions and re-arrangement of the hero content.
                        Importantly, our SEO ranking for key terms did increase. We returned to the front page of Google
                        search results for "event app" (and as of writing this case study are ranked #6). Our lighthouse
                        score was something we tested during development, it still remains very good. </p>

                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>While I wish we had slightly more time for development to allow more experimentation with things like
                using an actual 3d model in browser, I believe that under the given constraints and team size we
                produced a page which improved in meaningful ways over the previous iteration. The new design is clean,
                focused, and has set the bar for future additions and updates to the Guidebook marketing website. </p>
